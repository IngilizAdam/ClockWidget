# ClockWidget
A beautiful Clock Widget for your Desktop!

This is a clock widget that I programmed in the first year of Computer Science degree.
It's been coded with java and fully customizable without changing the source code!

# How to use?
To open the app, simply double-click "ClockWidget.jar" file.

To exit or change settings, just right-click on the icon which is located in the system tray and click "Open Settings".
You can even save themes and reuse them easily!

You can view the source code by opening ClockWidget.java file and even make some changes on it!
