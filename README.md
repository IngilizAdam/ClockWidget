# ClockWidget
A beautiful Clock Widget for your Desktop!

This is a clock widget that I programmed in the first year of Computer Science degree.
It's been coded with java and fully customizable without changing the source code!

Just right-click on the icon which is located in the system tray and click "Open Settings".
You can even save themes and reuse them easily!
